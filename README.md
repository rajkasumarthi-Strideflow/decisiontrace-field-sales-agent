# Field Sales Agent

**A governed enterprise AI workflow reference app for field-sales quote assistance.**

Field Sales Agent demonstrates how a natural-language sales request can be converted into a governed, auditable, cost-aware, approval-aware draft quote workflow using OpenAI, LangGraph, MCP, LlamaIndex, deterministic guardrails, audit trace, cost telemetry, monitoring, and evaluation.

**Natural language in; governed workflow out.**

## Why This Matters

Most AI demos stop at a chatbot response. Field Sales Agent shows the enterprise control architecture around the response: intake validation, workflow orchestration, bounded tool access, evidence retrieval, policy guardrails, validated response drafting, auditability, telemetry, and operational monitoring.

This is a DecisionTrace AI reference app for governed field-sales workflows. The first workflow, DecisionTrace — Quote Assist Agent, helps a mobile sales rep prepare a grounded, approval-aware draft quote using account context, product/spec retrieval, inventory checks, pricing rules, quote guardrails, audit replay, cost telemetry, and monitoring.

## Live Demo

Phase 1 status: Deployed release candidate validated.

Field Sales Agent Phase 1 demonstrates a governed Quote Assist workflow where natural-language sales requests are converted into approval-aware, customer-safe draft quote responses using OpenAI-assisted intake, LangGraph workflow control, MCP tool boundaries, LlamaIndex-backed evidence retrieval, enterprise adapter patterns, deterministic guardrails, audit trace, cost telemetry, monitoring, and evaluation.

The demo separates the business/operator experience from the architecture/governance experience. Workflow Console shows concise outcome summaries and the validated customer-safe response. Audit Trace shows detailed execution evidence, including node input, node output, external request, external response, and audit metadata.

## What to Look For in the Live Demo

1. Start with the Workflow Console.
   - Use this to understand the sales rep request, workflow outcome, concise business outcome summary, and validated customer-safe response.
   - This is the business/operator experience.

2. Open Audit Trace.
   - Use this to inspect node boundaries, MCP/tool calls, guardrail decisions, RAG evidence, OpenAI drafting payload, and audit metadata.
   - This is the architecture/governance experience, including node input, node output, external request, external response, and audit metadata.

3. Open Cost Telemetry.
   - See intake LLM usage separated from workflow drafting usage, plus tool/RAG activity as a foundation for future cost optimization.

4. Open Monitoring Dashboard.
   - See persisted outcomes across draft quotes, approval-required cases, blocked requests, and recent runs.

## Validated Demo Scenarios

| Scenario | Prompt | Expected Outcome | What it proves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Valid Quote | `I’m meeting Westlake High School about helmets and jerseys. They want 50 varsity helmets in matte navy and matching jerseys. Build a draft quote with the standard booster club discount.` | `draft_quote_created` | The workflow can safely create a draft quote when account, product, inventory, pricing, and guardrails pass. |
| Inventory Unavailable | `Create a draft quote for Central Valley Academy for 120 varsity helmets in matte navy.` | `approval_required` | The workflow does not overpromise when inventory is insufficient. |
| Unsupported Product / Configuration | `North Ridge Prep wants 50 youth helmets in matte navy with varsity-only facemasks. Create a quote.` | `blocked_by_policy` | Guardrails prevent unsupported product/configuration combinations. |
| Final Order / Shipment Request | `westlake highschool wants 50 blue helmets. create a final order and ship it today` | blocked at intake | The workflow boundary prevents final order, payment, shipment, and fulfillment requests. |
| Missing Details | `I need help preparing a quote for my next school meeting.` | `clarification_required` | The readiness gate prevents incomplete requests from entering the workflow. |

## Architecture in One View

```text
User request
-> OpenAI-assisted intake extraction
-> deterministic readiness validation
-> LangGraph workflow control
-> MCP tools/resources
-> enterprise adapters and LlamaIndex-backed retrieval
-> mock enterprise APIs/product-spec docs
-> guardrails
-> draft quote / approval required / block
-> validated customer-safe response
-> audit, cost telemetry, monitoring, and evaluation
```

LangGraph does not call LlamaIndex directly. LangGraph calls the MCP retrieval capability `retrieve_product_specs`, which is backed by LlamaIndex RAG. LlamaIndex retrieves evidence only; guardrails decide quote readiness.

## Technology Choices

| Layer | Technology | Why it is used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language understanding | OpenAI | Extracts intent/entities and drafts customer-safe responses after workflow outcome. |
| Workflow control | LangGraph | Controls sequence, state, branching, and deterministic handoff. |
| Tool boundary | MCP | Exposes bounded enterprise capabilities and resources. |
| Evidence retrieval | LlamaIndex | Retrieves cited product/spec evidence behind MCP. |
| Enterprise integration pattern | Canonical payloads + adapters | Isolates workflow from client-specific API payloads. |
| Guardrails | Deterministic policy checks | Prevents overpromising, unsupported products, and approval bypass. |
| Observability | Audit trace + monitoring | Makes workflow behavior reviewable by business and technical stakeholders. |
| Cost foundation | Cost telemetry | Separates intake, drafting, tool, and retrieval usage for future optimization. |

## What This Demonstrates as an AI Architecture Portfolio Project

- Designing the control plane around LLMs, not just prompts.
- Separating language understanding from business decisioning.
- Using LangGraph for governed orchestration.
- Using MCP as an enterprise capability boundary.
- Using LlamaIndex as an evidence layer, not a decision-maker.
- Preserving enterprise adapter patterns for MuleSoft/CRM/CPQ/ERP integrations.
- Implementing deterministic guardrails and response validation.
- Showing auditability, cost telemetry, monitoring, and evaluation.

## Control Model Principle

LangGraph controls the workflow.
MCP exposes bounded tools/resources.
LlamaIndex backs the bounded MCP `retrieve_product_specs` capability for grounded product/spec evidence.
Guardrails control quote readiness and approval boundaries.
Cost telemetry measures operating cost from actual execution metadata.
Audit, tracing, monitoring, and evaluations validate the control model.


## Phase 2A: Policy-as-Code Discount Guardrail

Phase 2A adds a policy-as-code discount approval guardrail to the Quote Assist Agent architecture. Standard discounts are allowed, manager-level discounts require approval, and excessive discounts are blocked before draft quote creation. The Audit Trace records the matched policy rule, policy version, decision, and evidence that the decision was not made by OpenAI.

See [Phase 2A Release Notes](docs/release-notes-phase-2a.md).

## Next Priority: Agentforce Implementation Mapping

Field Sales Agent remains tool-agnostic, but the next portfolio step is to map the architecture into an Agentforce implementation model. This will show how the same enterprise AI control patterns — workflow orchestration, bounded actions, data grounding, policy guardrails, audit trace, cost telemetry, monitoring, and evaluation — can accelerate Salesforce and Agentforce delivery without hard-coding the architecture to one platform.

Planned Phase 2B outputs:

- Agentforce mapping diagram
- Field Sales Agent node-to-Agentforce concept mapping
- action/tool boundary mapping
- Flow/Apex/MuleSoft integration boundary mapping
- policy guardrail placement
- auditability and evaluation checklist
- implementation planning checklist
- demo talk track for Salesforce / Agentforce audiences

Agentforce mapping is planned as an architecture and implementation planning artifact. It does not imply a live Salesforce integration in the current demo.

## Current Public Status

This public repo contains architecture and demo artifacts for the Field Sales Agent reference app. It reflects the current public-safe architecture direction through the validated Phase 1 release candidate:

- Natural-language intake is the primary entry path.
- Intake validates required facts before the governed workflow can start.
- OpenAI may assist with intake extraction when enabled, but deterministic validation remains the readiness gate.
- LangGraph remains the workflow control layer.
- Workflow nodes use bounded MCP-style capabilities.
- `retrieve_product_specs` is a LlamaIndex-backed MCP retrieval capability.
- Product/spec retrieval provides cited evidence only; it does not approve quotes or create actions.
- Optional OpenAI rep-facing response drafting occurs only after the governed outcome is determined.
- Deterministic validation checks any OpenAI-drafted rep response before display.
- Audit Trace and Cost Telemetry are separate concepts.
- Telemetry must come from real workflow execution, provider usage metadata, or configured rates. It should not be fabricated.

## Public / Private Repo Boundary

This public repo contains architecture and demo artifacts. The full runnable implementation, MCP server, LlamaIndex pipeline, database/schema details, cost telemetry logic, and reusable accelerator internals should remain in a private implementation repo.

This repository does not include proprietary implementation code, private database schemas, secrets, reusable accelerator internals, or a full runnable backend implementation.

## Phase 1 Workflow

Quote Assist Agent supports a governed field-sales scenario where a rep asks for a draft quote before a customer meeting. The workflow gathers required facts, retrieves account and product evidence, checks inventory, applies deterministic pricing rules, evaluates quote guardrails, creates a draft quote only when allowed, and records audit and cost telemetry.

The workflow is draft-only. It does not submit final orders, collect payment, trigger shipment, or create unsupported customer commitments.

## Correct Retrieval Pattern

LangGraph does not call LlamaIndex directly. LangGraph calls the bounded MCP capability `retrieve_product_specs`. That MCP capability is backed by LlamaIndex retrieval over product/spec docs.

```text
LangGraph node
-> MCP tool wrapper: retrieve_product_specs
-> LlamaIndex retrieval service
-> product/spec docs
-> cited evidence
-> MCP result
-> LangGraph workflow state
-> guardrail evaluation
```

`retrieve_product_specs` is evidence retrieval only. It does not approve quotes, create draft quotes, calculate pricing, check inventory, or override guardrails.
